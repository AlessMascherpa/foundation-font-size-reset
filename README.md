foundation-font-size-reset
==========================

Reset for a more accesible fonts in Zurb awesome Foundation front-end framework.

For a site to be accesible, among other things, it should allow users to resize the text by configuring the browser. See http://www.w3.org/WAI/changedesign

Foundation (foundation.zurb.com) has some accessibility issues with text (font) resizing this way. Same problems that twitter bootstrap (or Github, but that is not an OS framework) has. But in the case of foundation is relatively simple to avoid: 
Just grab the foundation-font-reset.min.css from stylesheets dir and link it to your web page.
